## Overview

Velero (formerly Heptio Ark) gives you tools to back up and restore your Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes. You can run Velero with a public cloud platform or on-premises. Velero lets you:

* Take backups of your cluster and restore in case of loss.
* Migrate cluster resources to other clusters.
* Replicate your production cluster to development and testing clusters.

Velero consists of:

* A server that runs on your cluster
* A command-line client that runs locally

## Documentation
